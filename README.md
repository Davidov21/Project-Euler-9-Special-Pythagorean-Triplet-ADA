# Project-Euler-9-Special-Pythagorean-Triplet-ADA
My solution to the project Euler problem 9 Special Pythagorean Triplet using the ADA programming language which is similar to C++

The prompt is
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

a2 + b2 = c2
For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.
